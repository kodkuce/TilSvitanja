5 day gam jam with lottery 4 word theme 

DESERT, WESTERN, RETRO, MIRROR > everybody knows where this is going :)

**~~Plan A~~**

Wanted to make rougelite like top down puzzle battler, where evry player action/move enemy does too
but to keep it Retro and use Mirror i would need to render a lot of pixel animations and i just wasted
4h yesterday on player char so no way i gona finish this is time. So plan A is dead long live planAv2 xD

**Plan A v2**

Still sticking to "From Dusk Till Dawn" theme cuz it matches theme so nice. So fast idea that thicks all boxes is
like that old retro [Wild Gunman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtQizdGWMhI) just with a twist using mirror to 
reflect light in the enemy. Hopfully this will work out right :)
